# Astra — Gymaf implementation and production blueprint

> Physix note, 8 September 2026: this directory is inherited source history. For work in `M:/physix-pro`, start with [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [the Physix plan](../docs/physix/README.md) and [tasks.md](../tasks.md). The historical statuses, product direction and provider assumptions below are not current Physix authority or release evidence.

Updated 5 September 2026. `/astra` is the documentation directory; `astra` is also the separate implementation branch. They are not the same thing. `main` remains separate from the current implementation work.

## Current implementation: start here

The owner requested actual implementation and local-agent testing. The `astra` branch now includes a connected web core, SQL migrations, local synthetic setup and tests. Read [LOCAL_TESTING](LOCAL_TESTING.md) for commands and accounts, [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for exact coverage, [ADR-007](ADR-007-CONNECTED-WEB.md) for implementation choices, and [CI evidence](evidence/astra-ci-2026-09-05.json) for observed passing checks. Full browser/provider/device/production acceptance is not claimed.

The original source audit is pinned to `97b24278bdc70f2e1f2cba373acfcd6c56e0664d`. Its findings and verification limits describe that historical baseline, not every subsequent commit. Earlier documentation-only statements apply to the initial documentation task; they are not a claim that this implementation branch contains no code.

## Agent reading order

Read root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), then the current implementation status and local handoff above. Read [DECISIONS](DECISIONS.md), [PRD](PRD.md), [FEATURES](FEATURES.md) and task-specific contracts for remaining work. The original [backlog](backlog.json) is a full release roadmap, not evidence that every new code path remains absent or that every implemented path is complete. Its `read` entries resolve relative to `/astra`.

For a ready-to-use local-agent assignment, open [AGENT_HANDOFF](AGENT_HANDOFF.md). Keep the existing visual language and avoid replacing working implementation with a generic rewrite.

## Status definitions

Observed source is not verified runtime behavior. Implemented means code is present; verified means the specified test passed at a named commit/environment. Planned native/payment/media operations are not working integrations. A passing build is not a security, privacy, visual, device or launch certificate.

Real client data and publication remain blocked until the corresponding technical and human release gates pass. The local synthetic seed and its MFA bypass must never be deployed to a real environment.
